        <p>
            Originally from NYC, I am an undergrad at Northeastern University c'24 studying CS with a Systems concentration. 
            During my 3 years here, I've worked with so many different technologies ranging from socket programming in Python
            to OOD with Java and mutex Programming in C. Over my time, I've developed a deep interest in networks and systems and a deep
            love for the art of coding. As someone went into CS with zero prior programming knowledge, there's still a long way for me
            to go, but I've learned so, so much and I am looking forward to blossoming even further and finding my own voice in tech.

            In my spare time, I enjoy diving deep into music of all types, going to concerts, riding public transportation &#40;I am from NYC after all!&#41;, 
            and travelling to all the less-talked-about places around me. I've always enjoyed dipping my toes into something new, whether it be a new
            programming language, a new neighborhood, or a new album.  One thing I love the most about myself is that I never stick with one thing for too long. I made this 
            website in the hopes that I can showcase my ever-changing interests. So please feel free to look around, I hope you have a fun time browsing through!
